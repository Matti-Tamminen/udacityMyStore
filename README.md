# MyStore
Course app to imitate basic netstore functionality. Contains separate frontend and backend projects.

## Init

1. npm i (storeFront)
2. frontend tests: /storeFront: 'ng test'
3. frontend server up: /storeFront: 'ng serve' (http://localhost:4200)

## Data

* Data is supplied from src/assets/data.json
* Ignore backend.

## Testing

* Backend has nothing meaningfull to test so testing is focused on the front (atm).
* Currency localisation is not ready, so magic strings are tested for currency.
